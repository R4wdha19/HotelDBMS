Create individual/seperate classes for each table

Every class should have functions to:
public static readFromTable(){
	take input from user to see how many users you have to print on console
	use SELECT query and ResultSets for showing
	
	}
	
public static getById(){
	take id input from the user
	print on console
	use SELECT query and ResultSets for showing
	}

public static updateById(){
	take id input from the user
	print on console
	use Update query and ResultSets for showing
	}

public static deleteById() {
	take id input from the user
	use Delete query
	}

public static makeIsActiveFalseById() {
	take id input from the user
	use Update query and just update 'is_Active' column
	}

public insertIntoTable(){
	take input from user how many number of rows are to be inserted
	input data in database using INSERT query in a loop
		Random rn = new Random();
		Integer numberToAdd = rn.nextInt(100);
	For string columns use: "rawdha" + numberToAdd;

	For Integer columns use: numberToAdd
	
	For Boolean columns use: true
	
	
	}
